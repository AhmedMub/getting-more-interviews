## Include words from job description to ben

- include them into objective and into technical knowledge

## Include company name you are applying to

- you can put the company name or something specific to that company like: maybe the comp looking for engineers who can improve their infrastructure, so should defiantly have those words or phrase to your objectives

## Does your first item on your resume reflect what they are looking for?

- this goes hand in hand with the job description or the comp name, but very first point in the technical knowledge or work experience should be exactly what thy are looking for, cause if you include words and write some random that is not very related to the job posting, the sent cv might not pass the ATS system.

## Experience titles demonstrate value

- the work experian which it the main part of the resume must show that you provide value

## Do you have an online link?

- include the online git and portfolio at the very top.

## Remove the word “I”

- Any sentence that starts with "I" like `["I wish", "I have", "I'm familiar", "I was hired"]`, as all thoses sentence does not really tell the recruiter anything and he/she wouldn't care, so you're like adding extra weight to the resume but you only have a few seconds to impress the recruiter, therefore as a recruiter will only be intersted and wanna know "WHAT YOU CAN OFFER US" and "WHAT TYPE OF ASSET YOU WOULD BE", so instead like writing:
  `["I wish to obtain a web design position" => "Professional web designer with five years of experience"]`
  thus get to the point right a way.

  ## No buzzwords describing how great you are

  - well buzzwords means don't put words and phrases that does not mean anything so words or phrases such as `['thought', 'leader', 'passionate', 'entrepreneur']`, becuase sometimes recrutires think negatively on these type of terms, so instead focus on using something called action words see as follows.

  ## Are you using Action words?

  - instead of using fig words that don't mean anything, use action words which descriew two things: What did you do, What were the results? and you can be very creative with it.
  - Action words could be like: "Testing the content management system and seeing that migration to the new servers is running smoothly."

  ## Measure everything in terms of impact, don’t just describe your responsibilities

  - Mention an impact of the the responsibilities rather than describing such as mention How much did the traffic improved because of the this migration to new servers, as a recruiter can see an impact that you had on the business, because don't forget that companies hire people that are asset to improve the company and create more revenue for them, so you should demonstrate an impact.

  ## Technical Knowledge/Skills should include what they are looking for. Only show years if it is impressive

  - Don't mentions the coding years unless it is impressive like "I have experience of coding with Java for 1 year", this is not good looking skill so don't show the number.

  ## Include only sections/items that are impressive: Experience, Projects, Education, Technical Skills

  - Only include sections that a recruiter really cares about
  - Only include experience that is relevant to the domain you are applying for.

  ## No typos or bad grammar

  - double check for the grammar or words mistakes and whatnot.
